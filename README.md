Eventually, `goosey` will open up a GUI game... `goosey --debug [fen] -depth=[depth=3]` will open up a debug GUI with search tree up to depth. Will have UCI to test against other bots/plug into Lichess.

Board representation -> generate all legal moves -> search & evaluate for good move -> play move -> factor in a clock
